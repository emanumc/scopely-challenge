# Scopely Challenge

1. ~~In the center of the provided battlefield there is a Base for the player to defend. Create a system of spawnable “creeps”. Creeps spawn from the SpawnPoints already placed in the battlefield. When they spawn, they automatically move towards the Base in a straight line (don’t implement or integrate any pathfinding, as NavMesh) . Make the timing, number, and behavior of spawned creeps easy to tweak and tune.~~
2. ~~When a number of creeps reach the player’s base, inform the player that has lost the game -- feel free to add a health bar to the creeps or to the base. When the game is lost, display the LosePopup.~~
3. ~~Create a system of placeable turrets . The player can instantiate a turret anywhere on the battlefield.~~
4. ~~Make the turrets shoot projectiles at creeps. Projectiles that hit creeps cause damage to them. Make the parameters for the amount of damage caused by a projectile and the amount of damage a creep can take easy to tune and tweak.~~
5. ~~Implement a simple economy such as making each turret cost 5 coins to build and each creep giving you a coin when it dies.~~
6. Implement two types of turrets with different capabilities: a regular one and a freeze/slow-down effect on the other. (You have both assets provided).
7. ~~Add different types of creeps with varying attributes such as speed and hit points. (You have two different creep assets provided).~~
8. Implement a system of waves. Once all the creeps of a particular wave are cleared, the next wave starts. If all the waves are cleared and the base is still alive, then display the WinPopup .
